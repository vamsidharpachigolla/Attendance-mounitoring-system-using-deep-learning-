Attendance Monitoring System Using Deep Learning
📌 Overview
This project implements an automated attendance monitoring system using deep learning-based facial recognition. The goal is to replace traditional manual or RFID-based attendance systems with a more efficient, contactless, and accurate solution.

🧠 Key Features
🎯 Face detection and recognition using Deep Learning (CNN)

📷 Real-time camera feed for capturing attendance

🗂️ Attendance is logged with name, ID, date, and time

🧾 Records stored in CSV or database format

👥 Easily scalable for multiple users

🔒 High accuracy with anti-spoofing measures (optional)

🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python

Libraries/Frameworks:

OpenCV


dlib / face_recognition (optional for faster prototyping)

Database (optional):

SQLite / MySQL / Firebase

GUI (optional):

Tkinter / Flask / Streamlit

⚙️ How It Works
Dataset Collection
Collect facial images of students (multiple angles recommended).

Model Training
Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for facial recognition or use pre-trained models like FaceNet / VGGFace.

Face Recognition
Compare real-time face input with the database embeddings to identify students.

Attendance Logging
Log identified students' names and timestamps into a .csv or database.
